DESCRIPTION:

satcli is a command line interface to the Red Hat Network Satellite 
Server API, and is built on the Cement CLI Application Framework.


USAGE:

    $ satcli --help
    
    
PLUGIN DEVELOPMENT:

satcli supports external plugins via the Cement Framework.  To quick
start a new plugin for this application you can use the paster utility.

Setup a virtual environment for development:
    
    $ virtualenv --no-site-package /path/to/env
    
    $ source /path/to/env/bin/activate
    
    
Install satcli:
    
    $ cd /path/to/satcli
    
    $ python setup.py develop
    

Create and install the plugin:

    $ mkdir plugins
    
    $ cd plugins
    
    $ paster cement-plugin satcli myplugin
    
    $ cd satcli-plugins-myplugin
    
    $ python setup.py develop
    
    
Once your plugin is installed, you can add the plugin to the enabled_plugins
setting in /etc/satcli/satcli.conf (or the path to the config).  
Additionally, the plugin configurations can be set in 
/etc/satcli/plugins.d/myplugin.conf. You should then see some example 
commands/options show up with:

    $ satcli --help
    
    
Then, code away!
