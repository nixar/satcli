# This is an example application config using cement.  Some config options

# PLUGINS
#
# Plugins are enabled under their [plugin] config either in this
# file or in the plugins.d config file for that plugin.  An example plugin
# config looks like:
#
#   [example]
#   enable_plugin = true
#   provider = rosendale
#
#
# The 'provider' is the package that provides it.  If it is an internal plugin
# this can be left blank.
#

# [namespace]
# Additional namespace/plugin configurations can go here.
